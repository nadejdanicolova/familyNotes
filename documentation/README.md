Every authenticated user can rise his own even in one of the main three topics. Event is an activity which he or she is going to do at a specified date and place in the near future. By rising the event the member proposes his/her idea to all the site members and invites them to join the particular event, be part of his team an have fun together.

If you sure participating the event, you can put comments and share ideas, photos.

#### Users

Private view is only by the user itself and the public part is only visible by other already authenticated group members.

#### Small marketplace

In the next project stage we plan to extend the app with a small marketplace, where all users can share private and 100% free advertisements for selling or buying equipment like snowboard, ski, bikes, helmets, googles, e.t.c.
Again this part is visible to all site visitors and the add new button is allowed only to registered users.
